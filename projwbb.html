  <h1>The Wholesome Wealth-Being Project</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>I happen to have had a substantial career in the field of finance because I have seemed to deal well with numbers since I was a child.</p>
  <p>And it increasingly fascinates me, that unlike what many may believe, being good with money seems to have little to do with being good with numbers, and much to do with our behaviours, psychology, and mindsets.</p>
  <p>On this page, I explore some good resources on creating habits and practices that grow our long term financial well-being, much like the good habits that foster our long term physical health.</p>
  <p>This is neither general nor specific financial advice. Please seek professional advice for your own circumstances.</p>
